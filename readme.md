> 40+ hours of video instruction and code-along sessions that teach you the foundational concepts, theory, and techniques you need to know to become an effective data scientist with Python.

## Overview

This repository contains the exercises and data for Data Science Fundamentals Part 1: Learning Basic Concepts, Data Wrangling, and Databases with Python and Data Science Fundamentals Part 2: Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis. It teaches you the foundational concepts, theory, and techniques you need to know to become an effective data scientist. The videos present you with applied, example-driven lessons in Python and its associated ecosystem of libraries, where you get your hands dirty with real datasets and see real results.
