> 40+ hours of video instruction and code-along sessions that teach you the foundational concepts, theory, and techniques you need to know to become an effective data scientist with Python.

## Overview

This repository contains the exercises and data for [Data Science Fundamentals Part 1: Learning Basic Concepts, Data Wrangling, and Databases with Python](http://jonathans.estate/ds-fun-1-videos) and [Data Science Fundamentals Part 2: Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis](http://jonathans.estate/ds-fun-2-videos). It teaches you the foundational concepts, theory, and techniques you need to know to become an effective data scientist. The videos present you with applied, example-driven lessons in Python and its associated ecosystem of libraries, where you get your hands dirty with real datasets and see real results.

## Materials

The code, slides, and exercises in this repository are (and will always be) freely available. The corresponding videos can be purchased on:

* The importance of creating reproducible analyses and how to share them effectively

## Who Should Take This Course

* Aspiring data scientists looking to break into the field and learn the essentials necessary
* Journalists, consultants, analysts, or anyone else who works with data and looking to take a programmatic approach to exploring data and conducting analyses
* Quantitative researchers interested in a programmatic and systematic approach to working with data and data pipelines.
* Software engineers interested in the fundamentals and best practices of working with data.
* Practicing data scientists already familiar with another programming environment looking to learn how to do data science with Python

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of programming
* Familiarity with Python and relational databases are a plus
